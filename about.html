        <p>
          I'm an Engineering Psychology student from Aalto University.
          For a long time, I've been interested in psychology, math and computer science.
          I luckily found a way to combine these interests by studying how game-theoretical models
	        can be applied for human-computer interaction.
          Currently, I aim to apply these skills to create solutions that make new technologies
          easier to work with and adopt. In my free time I like to sing in a choir, play piano and do
          various sports. On this website you can find projects I have worked on. 
          Hope you enjoy my portfolio! :&#41
