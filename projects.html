                <h2>A conceptual framework to evaluate economic decision-making in Human-Computer Interaction</h2>
                <p>
                    As a part of my bachelor's thesis, I developed a framework to evaluate decision-making in
                    economic games. The framework differed from pre-existing frameworks in that it considered interactions
                    with non-human agents, such as AI players. My thesis as a whole considered the use of game-theory as
                    a tool to evaluate economic decision-making in Human-Computer Interaction.

                <h2>Study on psychological effects of social media on students</h2>
                <p>
                    We conducted a questionnaire study with my fantastic groupmates Tiina Erho and Urho Läärä to investigate the relationship
                    of psychological effects and social media usage on students. We used a survey to collect
                    the data and analyzed it using R. The study was presented to professors and doctoral researchers
                    in Aalto University. The report is currently only available in Finnish.

                <h2>Discord bot to play music on voice channel with natural language query</h2>
                <p>
                    As the widely used Discord bot "Rhythm" that usually plays music on voice channels was down,
                    I did a small project to develop a Discord bot that plays music by downloading the audio from Youtube
                    and playing it online similarly as the "Rhythm" bot. You could prompt the bot a natural language search query
                    and it automatically found the most relevant audio from Youtube and played it.

                <h2>Machine learning model to predict user activity from smartphone's sensor data</h2>
                <p>
                    I developed a machine learning model as part of course CS-C3240 "Machine Learning", which was trained
                    on a dataset of smartphone sensor data. Two machine learning methods were used:
                    logistic regression and decision trees. I then compared the performance of the two methods.
                    Both of the methods were able to predict user activity from unseen smartphone sensory data with a good accuracy.

                <h2>Scala library to visualize numerical data</h2>
                <p>
                    I created a data-visualization library for numerical json-formatted data. The library formed a graph that represented the
                    inputted data and automatically adjusted the graph's range and scale for values depending on the data. Users could also
                    name the graph axis and add a title to the graph.
